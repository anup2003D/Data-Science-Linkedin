# 🚀 Data Science – Learning Journey

This repository contains all the Python code from my **Data Science** learning streak.  
Every day, I learn one new concept in Data Science and Machine Learning and implement it through a simple Python script.

The goal of this repo is to:
- 📚 Build a strong foundation in DS/ML  
- 🎯 Maintain consistency through daily learning  
- 💡 Share beginner-friendly, practical examples  
- 📈 Track progress from basics to real-world ML workflows
