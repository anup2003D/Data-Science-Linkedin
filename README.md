# 🚀 Data Science – Learning Journey

This repository contains all the Python code from my **Data Science** learning streak.  
Every day, I learn one new concept in Data Science and Machine Learning and implement it through a simple Python script.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Build a strong foundation in DS/ML  
- Maintain consistency through daily learning  
- Share beginner-friendly, practical examples  
- Track progress from basics to real-world ML workflows  

---

## 📂 What's Inside?
Each file `DayX.py` includes:
- A single focused DS/ML concept  
- Clean, runnable code  
- Real dataset examples  
- Step-by-step implementation  

Topics covered include:
- Python for Data Science  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Feature Engineering & Selection  
- Evaluation Metrics  
- Regression & Classification Models  
- Model Training & Testing  
- End-to-End ML Workflow  
- Mini Projects (later in the streak)

---

## 🧠 Who Is This For?
- Beginners learning Data Science  
- Students working on ML basics  
- Anyone who wants daily, bite-sized DS concepts  
- People who prefer practical, code-first learning  

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open any `DayX.py` file  
2. Read the concept name at the top  
3. Run the script  
4. Modify and experiment  

Everything in this repo is designed to be **simple, clear, and practical**.
